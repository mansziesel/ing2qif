---

### Goal:
---
Make it easy to keep GnuCash up to date. Some transaction details are lost to make matching work better.
This may or may not be acceptable for you.

It's based around the Dutch ING statements.

### Usage:
------

 $ python ing2qif.py statements.csv

* Note: This was designed around statements from ING in The Netherlands.
* Note 2: Other then suffering the ING statement format, there is no relation with ING
